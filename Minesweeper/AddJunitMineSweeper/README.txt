Team 10
Corbin Smith, Van Nguyen, Graham Mix
We used Eclipse, and we are simply zipping up the project folder so it should be simply importable we have a lot of individual minefield text files representing different
scenarios so those need to be in there. To avoid running in the command line or dealing with paths we simply put them in the main project directory.
To run simply run MineSweeperTester.java and all 15 tests will pass.
